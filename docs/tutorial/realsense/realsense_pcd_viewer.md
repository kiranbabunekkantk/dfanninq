# Realsense PCD viewer

We offen want to convert the input from a depth sensor into a point cloud to make it easier to compute a later processing.
In this tutorial, we convert the RGBD images from Realsense into point cloud and display it on the viewer.

First, you need to install a necessary package.

```
pip install pyrealsense2
```
